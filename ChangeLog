	* lennard-jones-coeffs.dat: Added data for SiH4 from Table 4
	Shashkov et al 2011 article.

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (make-lennard-jones-6/12-potential):
	Changed call convention to accept coefficients as arguments.  A
	different routine will return an object based on a species
	(make-species-lennard-jones-6/12-potential): new routine that
	accepts the species and returns object with coefficients.

	* object-setup.lisp (molecular-potential): Removed default value
	for `epsilon/K'.  It will be set-up by individual objects

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (print-object): Same modification as
	in the hard-sphere print definition below

	* hs-molecular-potential.lisp: New 'hard-sphere-potential' class
	and helper routines.
	(print-object): Fixed insiduous bug.  I was retreiving the slot
	value of species, even if it was not bound.  This would cause an
	error that would try to print the object again, and again, and
	again ...

	* object-setup.lisp (V): Modified documentation in light of new
	specification of hard-sphere potential
	(molecular-potential): Added `mass' and `species' slots.  Mass is
	important for collision calculations.  Also changed accessors from
	:accessor to :reader

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (lennard-jones-6/12-potential):
	Cleaned-up exported symbols.  From now on, other packages use the
	object interface to obtain potential parameters.

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (make-lennard-jones-6/12): Removing
	the option to create a combined potential.  This is outside the
	domain of this package, but in the domain of the
	collision-integrals package.
	(lennard-jones-6/12-potential): Renamed class `lennard-jones-6/12'
	into more descriptive `lennard-jones-6/12-potential'
	(print-object, describe-object): 

2011-09-06  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* lj-molecular-potential.lisp: Renamed `lj-coeffs' into
	`lennard-jones-6/12' in the whole file

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp: Renamed `lj-coeffs' into
	`lennard-jones-6/12' in the whole file

2011-09-05  Mirko Vukovic  <mirko.vukovic@us.tel.com>

	* lennard-jones-coeffs.lisp (lj-coeffs): Class inherits from new
	base class, molecular-potentials

	* generic-functions.lisp (molecular-potential): Added class
	definition of molecular-potential
