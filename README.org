#+title: Molecular-potentials package

* Summary
  System for specifying molecular potential parameters and calculating
  molecular potentials.

  Included potentials
  - [ ] Hard Sphere
  - [X] Lennard-Jones 6-12
  - [ ] Variable hard sphere
  - [ ] Variable soft sphere
    
    
  Methods:
  - [ ] Potential calculations
  - [ ] Lennard-Jones 6-12 for collisions of two different types of molecules

* To do
  Modify format of the [[file:lennard-jones-coeffs.dat][lennard-jones-coeffs.dat]] file.  Right now it is
  based on a table from Bird & Lightfoot and contains Tc data.  I want
  to remove unnecessary data and add fields for the data source.
