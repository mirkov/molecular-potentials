Common Lisp package for molecular potential models

The package defines objects and methods for a few simple
inter-molecular potential models.  The package has nothing to do with
ab-initio calculations of molecular potentials.

The package is used by the =collision-integrals= package for
calculation of transport coefficients of rare gases.

For each potential model, package provides the following:
- Function =V(r)= for the potential
- Object of base type molecular potential that stores the model
  parameters.  The objects must return
  - =sigma=, the characteristic diameter
  - =epsilon/K=, the characteristic temperature

The exception to this rule is the hard-sphere potential, which does
not have a corresponding object.

The function =V= is implemented as a generic function/method with
call syntax
#+begin_src lisp
(V potential r)
#+end_src
where potential is either an object for a particular potential, or a
scalar diameter for the hard-sphere potential.
